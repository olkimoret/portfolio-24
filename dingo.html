						            <p>Dingo was a project I initiated to enable blind users to better interact with digital content, especially on mobile devices. To immerse myself in their experience, I used screen readers and navigated public spaces blindfolded. </p>
						        	<p>Through observational studies and in-depth user interviews, I aimed to identify where traditional UI design—typically tailored for sighted users—could be significantly improved for the blind community.</p>

						            <h2 class="major">Problem Definition</h2>
						            <p>Blind users often rely on screen readers and voice-over features to access content, type messages, or use apps. These tools can be challenging to use, especially in noisy environments like streets, bars, or coffee shops. <p>
						            	<p>Existing solutions, such as bulky braille keyboards or limited mobile input methods, are often cumbersome or restricted by specific operating systems, making it difficult for blind users to switch devices or use someone else’s phone. </p>
						            	<p>My goal was to create a more adaptable and efficient solution to support blind users in their daily interactions with technology.</p>
						            	<p>Here are some braille keyboards available today. They are expensive, large and nececite hours of training and a power source:</p>

						            <p>My vision for Dingo was a universal input system with the following requirements:</p>
						            <ul>
						                <li>Independent of any specific operating system</li>
						                <li>Based on braille to avoid introducing a new learning curve</li>

						            <h2 class="major">Prototype #1: Initial Concept</h2>
						            <h3 class="major">The idea</h3>
						            <p>I started by learning braille to better understand the input process. My first prototype allowed users to type on a blank screen, with the phone recognizing the pattern of 6 dots (forming each braille character), regardless of where they tapped. This prototype served as a foundational step toward a more intuitive input method.</p>

						            <h3 class="major">UX research</h3>
						            <p>In testing early prototypes, I found users struggled with the unfamiliar input system. Users where trying to figure out where to touch the screen rather than trusting the app to recognize their input. This was  agreat learnign moment where I understood that even more so then sighted users, blind users create mental model of app and processes that I will have to understand and work with.</p>

						            <h3 class="major">The idea</h3>
						            <p>I shifted to a gesture-based input system, where users could draw shapes on the screen to input text or commands. </p>
						        	<p>These gestures were designed using the same numerical notation used to learn braille, allowing for a straightforward explanation to non-sighted users.</p>
						        	<div class="image wide"><img class="" src="images/dingo/prototype-02b.png" alt="a visualization of how to translate the word DINGO in braille then in symbols" /></div>
						            <h3 class="major">UX research</h3>
						            <p>During this research, I needed users to associate gestures with meanings, actions, and letters. Since I couldn't show them a visualization of the gestures, I created clay models of an iPhone with symbols carved into them. Participants paired braille cards (representing meanings) with clay "phones" (representing gestures). </p>

						        	<p>While some gestures were consistently linked to similar meanings, there was no clear pattern across the user panel, leading me to realize that users might prefer to define their own gestures.</p>

						            <h2 class="major">Prototype #3: User-Defined Gestures with Machine Learning</h2>
						            <p>To address the feedback, I collaborated with a software engineer to integrate a machine learning system into my prototype. <p/>
						            <p>This new prototype could map user-defined gestures to specific commands and actions, creating a personalized experience for each user and allow the system to learn each user’s unique gestures over time.</p>

						            <h3 class="major">UX research</h3>
						            <p>I partnered with a UX researcher to conduct a series of testing and interviews at a school for the blind near Berkeley CA.</P>
						            <p>We interviewed dozens of users and received many praises for the interface we created. Many students were excited about the potential application in specific apps and the type of control this could give them.</p>
						        	<p>During our research, we also uncovered a generational shift in technology use: younger blind users were less and less fluent in braille and relied more and more on voice commands. </p>
						        	<p>An unexpected finding was the concern many blind users had about safety and theft when using their expensive phones in public. Several participants mentioned feeling uneasy, worrying that someone might snatch their phone from their hands or even from a table. To address this, my next prototype will be a discreet physical device that allows users to control their phones without needing to take them out of their bags. This solution will be OS-agnostic, designed for ease of use and addressing similar pain points then the gesture system.</p>

						            <h2 class="major">Impact and Results</h2>
						            <p>The Dingo project showcased the potential for a more inclusive, user-defined input system that allows blind users to interact with their phones more naturally and efficiently. Although the COVID-19 pandemic paused further development, the project’s insights and prototypes laid a strong foundation for future exploration in accessible design. By focusing on the unique needs of blind users from the start, rather than retrofitting existing systems, I was able to highlight the importance of true user-centered design in accessibility.</p>

						            <p>Working on Dingo taught me the value of deep empathy and immersion in understanding user needs, especially for those with disabilities. I learned that simply retrofitting accessible features onto existing designs often falls short. Instead, we need to create solutions that are specifically tailored to the unique experiences of each user group. This project reinforced my belief in the power of innovative, user-centered research and design to create more inclusive products and services.</p>
