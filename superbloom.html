				                <p>Superbloom was a pioneering project I led within Google to tackle a common challenge in digital advertising: the rigidity of ad templates.</p>
				                <p>Traditional Google ads used fixed templates, limiting customization and failing to capture the unique identity of our clients' brands.</p>
				                <p>My goal for Superbloom was to create a dynamic system that allowed ads to be tailored more flexibly to the diverse needs of advertisers, whether they were a small local business or a large corporation.</p>
				                <p>The impact of this project extended beyond Google Display ads and influenced ad creation across platforms, including YouTube, setting a new standard for customizable, high-quality digital advertising.</p>

				                <h2 class="major">Context</h2>
								<p>To understand the scope of this project, it’s essential to first explore how traditional online ads are generated.</p>
								<h3 class="major">How Online Ads Work</h3>
								<p>As a webpage loads, a space is reserved for Google ads. Through an auction process, an advertiser interested in promoting a product is selected. Google then creates an ad format on behalf of the advertiser and displays it on the website or app.</p>
								<div class="image wide"><img src="images/Superbloom/01-ad-system.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3 class="major">Ad Templates</h3>
								<p>To build the ad, Google uses assets provided by the advertiser, arranging them according to a pre-set format template.</p>
								<div class="image wide"><img src="images/Superbloom/02-template.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3 class="major">Examples of Ads</h3>
								<p>These ads are highly responsive, adapting seamlessly to various sizes, languages, and devices. They can handle a wide range of asset qualities, text lengths, image aspect ratio, and even cases of missing logo or colors.</p>

				            <div class="content">
				                <h2 class="major">Problem Definition</h2>
				                <p>Advertisers were confined to using hard-coded ad templates that offered little flexibility, resulting in ads that looked similar regardless of the business type.</p>
				                <p>This uniformity didn't effectively communicate the unique value or brand identity of diverse businesses, whether it was a local funeral home or a trendy candy shop.</p>
				                <h3 class="major">Different Advertisers</h3>
				                <p>Here are three advertisers with very different brand identity, marketing goals and target audiences.</p>
				                <div class="image wide"><img src="images/Superbloom/04-adv.png" alt="" /></div>
				                <h3 class="major">One Size Fits All Ad Formats</h3>
				                <p>While very efficient and extreamly responsive to their context, traditional ad formats fail to capture the uniqueness of each brand or to tailor the message to each particular audience, resulting in a one size fits no-one type of advertisement.</p>
				                <div class="image wide"><img src="images/Superbloom/05-ads.png" alt="" /></div>
				                <h3 class="major">Superbloom: a new type of ad format</h3>
				                <p>With Superbloom, I aimed to develop a solution that could produce distinct, high-quality ads automatically—respecting the individuality of each business while still leveraging the scalability of Google’s ad infrastructure.<br>This involved accurately understanding and representing brand identities, enhancing the quality of assets provided by advertisers, and delivering ads that resonated with different audiences, without manual intervention.</p>

				                <h3 class="major">My Role</h3>
				                <p>My role was to define and champion the vision for Superbloom, transforming a vague concept into a compelling product vision.</p>
				                <p>I guided the project through numerous iterations, ensuring that the design and development stayed true to the core objective of creating bespoke ads on the behalf of the advertisers.</p>
				                <h3 class="major">1 UX among 15 ENG</h3>
				                <p>I actively participated in strategic planning, setting clear goals, and communicating the vision across teams.<br>My leadership was instrumental in aligning cross-functional teams, including engineering, product management, and AI research, around a shared understanding of what Superbloom aimed to achieve.</p>
				                <p>I also provided course corrections when different parts of the team veered off track, keeping everyone focused on delivering a product that balanced innovation with practical advertiser needs.</p>
				                <h3 class="major">Vision</h3>
				                <p>Not only engeneering, AI research and product had different individual goals but the overall direction for the project was very obscure since it was the first of its kind, using technology that was developped as we were workign on it. To rally all teams a common goal, I had to create a strong product vision and established with clear yet flexible milestones. Storytelling and visualization were the most efficient tools.</p>

				                <h2 class="major">Challenges and Key Decisions</h2>
				                <p>The project faced several significant challenges.</p>
				                <p>One was how to accurately understand and represent the brand identity of diverse advertisers automatically, without manual intervention.<br>This involved developing AI models that could interpret brand guidelines, colors, and styles from minimal input.</p>
				                <p>Another challenge was dealing with low-quality assets provided by advertisers.<br>Many small businesses lacked the resources to produce high-quality images or videos, which were essential for effective ads.</p>

				                <p>My team and I decided to focus on enhancing these assets through AI rather than changing the entire ad submission process.<br>We prioritized developing tools like the uncropping feature, which could intelligently extend image backgrounds, and a tool that enhanced the quality of low-resolution images.</p>
				                <h3 class="major">Example of AI feature: smart cropping</h3>

				                <h2 class="major">Research and Insights</h2>
				                <p>User research played a critical role in shaping Superbloom’s direction.</p>
				                <p>Through interviews and testing with a diverse range of advertisers, we discovered that small and medium-sized businesses were particularly receptive to AI-driven ad solutions.</p>
				                <p>These businesses often lacked the resources for professional marketing and were excited about the prospect of automated, high-quality ads.</p>
				                <p>Conversely, larger corporations, which typically have established brand guidelines and creative teams, were more hesitant to adopt automated solutions, fearing a loss of creative control.</p>
				                <p>These insights led me to refine the product’s focus, prioritizing features that offered value to smaller businesses while ensuring that larger advertisers could maintain a level of oversight and customization.</p>

				                <p>I played a key role in facilitating communication and cooperation between teams responsible for different aspects of the project—from front-end design to back-end engineering and AI research.</p>
				                <p>I participated in sprints with other teams, sharing my expertise in ad formats and ensuring that everyone was aware of the technology we were developing.</p>
				                <p>I also organized workshops to present the latest tools and features created for Superbloom, fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing.<br>These workshops not only helped avoid potential roadblocks but also generated interest from other parts of Google, leading to collaborations with teams like YouTube Ads.</p>
