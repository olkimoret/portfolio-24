					                <p>My journey in cake-making began when my first child turned one. What started as a potentially fun new family tradition has evolved into an annual challenge to master new techniques and create memorable cakes for two demending "clients".</p>
					                <p>I’ve progressively built my skills and expanded my repertoire of creative and technically challenging cake designs.</p>

					                <h2 class="major">Challenges and Initial Context</h2>
					                <p>While I enjoyed cooking and baking, I initially lacked the technical expertise needed to bring my kids' ambitious cake visions to life. Each year presented new challenges, from mastering the art of icing and fondant sculpting to conquering advanced techniques like sugar decorations.</p>
									<p>Some projects proved particularly demanding—like crafting sugar waves, which required a mountain of sugar to be sacrificed before I could satisfy my "clients' expectations." Additional hurdles, such as transportation, unpredictable weather, and the ever-persistent laws of gravity, further pushed my skills and creativity to their limits.</p>

					                <h2 class="major">Solutions and Approach</h2>
					                <p>To manage these challenges, I adopted a systematic approach, testing and mastering one new skill each year. This incremental strategy ensured steady growth without turning cake-making into a full-time occupation.</p>
									<p>Effective planning became essential, incorporating project management techniques to streamline workflows and avoid last-minute surprises. Managing my "clients'" ever-growing imaginations also became a critical part of the process, helping to minimize unexpected changes and maintain a clear vision for each project.</p>

					                <h2 class="major">Results</h2>
					                <p>Over the years, I’ve blended physical engineering with aesthetic design to create cakes inspired by fire trucks, Disney princesses, towering skyscrapers, dirt bike race tracks, monster trucks, Hot Wheels jumps—and even a toilet.</p>
									<p>Throughout this journey, I’ve honed my skills by baking tastier cakes, crafting my own fondant, layering ganache, piping intricate icing designs, sculpting gum paste figurines, and mastering the art of pulling sugar.</p>
									<p>Currently, I’m embracing new challenges, such as designing a cake with a surprise liquid center, to further push the boundaries of cake artistry.</p>

					                <p>This journey has taught me the importance of incremental learning and meticulous planning. Each cake represents not only technical growth but also shared experiences that bring loved ones together.</p>
					                <p>As my skills continue to grow, so do the expectations of my "clients", inspiring me to raise the bar each year and deliver even better creations.</p>
